I am an Associate Professor of the Practice for Multilingual Learner Education in the Department of Teaching and Learning at Vanderbilt University. My teaching and research focus on teacher preparation for working with multilingual learners, particularly related to culturally and linguistically responsive approaches for teaching and learning. I have 20 years of language teaching and teacher education experience, and my credentials include a PhD in Literacy, Culture, and Language Education from Indiana University (2016), a Masterâ€™s in the Theory and Practice of Teacher Education with a concentration in English as a Second Language Education from the University of Tennessee (2008), and a BA in English Literature from Shenandoah University in Winchester, VA.

I provide professional development, mentoring, and consulting for school districts, individual teachers, and language programs. This work has included language programs in South Korea, Thailand, Albania and in K-12 schools and language centers around the U.S.
